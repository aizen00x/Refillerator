# Refillerator
In this project a Raspberry Pi device is
used to model an IoT self-replenishing refrigerator with
the use of Amazon Dash replenishment services. Often,
we reach for fridge items necessary for different recipes
we are making only to find that these items have run out.
The re-fillerator ensures that your fridge is always
replenished of the necessary items needed daily. With the
use of force sensors primarily, we will be able to tell when
a product is running low by placing it in its designated
slot. Once the device is connected to DRS, low force
sensor measures will trigger replenishment, or for the
items to be ordered with the provided address and
payment information. As a prototype, a Frigidaire mini
fridge is utilized to model real-life usage of this product.
